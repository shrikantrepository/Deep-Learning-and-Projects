# Deep-Learning and Projects

## Why this repository?
• The main purpose of making this repository is to keep all my Deep Learning projects at one place, hence keeping my GitHub clean!


## Overview
• This repository consists of all my Deep Learning projects.

• Datasets are provided in each of the folders above, and the solution to the problem statements as well.

### List of Deep Learning algorithms that are used in these projects --

### Neural Networks:
• Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

• Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

• Convolution Neural Network (CNN)

### ANN Projets

• Churn_Modelling - This data set contains details of a bank's customers and the target variable is a binary variable reflecting the fact whether the customer left the bank (closed his account) or he continues to be a customer.


### CNN Projets

### RNN Projets


Do ⭐ the repository, if it helped you in anyway.
