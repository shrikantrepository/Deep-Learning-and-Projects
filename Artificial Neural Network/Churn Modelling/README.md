## Churn Modelling - Bank Customer Retension 
### Project Overview
1. *Created a model that predicts whether the customer left the bank (closed his account) or he continues to be a customer.*
1. *Engineered features ....*
3. *Optimized Artificial Neural Network using GridsearchCV to reach the best model*


### Resources Used
1. *Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, keras*
1. *Dataset by Shruti Iyyer : https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimechlearn/churn-modelling*

### Data Cleaning
- *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*

### Feature Engineering
1. *Transformed the categorical variables into dummy variables*
2. *Split the data into train and tests sets*

### Model Building
#### Algorithms used for this project are as follows:
1. *Sequential (ANN)*
2. *Sequential (ANN) with GridSearchCV*

#### Activation functions
- *ReLU, LeakyReLU, ELU*

#### Optimizer functions
- *he_uniform, glorot_uniform, adam*
